# emberTools
Some tools for my group to be able to use the ember dataset quickly.
    
    Change directory function to be in the working directory of the ember data.
    
    Note that you only need to run prep_json_files() a single time.
    
    This is able to load in all the data however it's not worth it and we need to tackle this in smaller chunks.
